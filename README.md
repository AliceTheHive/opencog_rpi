Opencog Cross Compile Toolchain for Raspberry Pi3

This repo contains the compiler, needed libraries and script to
cross compile and install opencog on a RPI3 board. 

# Usage

The octool_rpi.sh script handles most of the work for both 
cross compiling on a fancy machine and installing on a RPI 
running raspbian. 

The switches to the script:

```
Usage: octool_rpi.sh OPTION
Tool for installing necessary packages and preparing environment
for OpenCog on a Raspberry PI computer running Raspbian OS.
  -d   Install base/system dependancies.
  -o   Install OpenCog (precompilled: may be outdated)
  -t   Download and Install Cross-Compilling Toolchain
  -c   Cross Compile OpenCog (Run on PC!)
  -v   Verbose output
  -h   This help message
```


To install the base dependancies of opencog on the RPI,
use the ```-d``` switch. 

To install opencog with a debian package of pre-compiled 
binaries use the ```-o``` switch. This downloads a .deb
package and installs it on the system. 
It assumes that you have the base dependancies installed 
so it's best to run the following to first install the 
dependancies and then opencog. 
```
    ./octool_rpi.sh -do
```
